1st Commit: Adjusted array structure to accommodate gender, hobbies, and fussiness.
Prints as expected

3nd Commit: add_single method also sorts the singles according to fussiness, in ascending order.
Prints as expected
Algorithm now takes single that is most fussy and least fussy on a date first
Prints as expected
Couples and singles now match the expected output, other than Reese and Quinn

4th Commit: added an algorithm that implements aga and zin aspect of the program.
Haven't yet tested it, so don't know if it works.

5th Commit: improved on the aga and zin algorithms.
They work, but get stuck on an infinite loop when the avg_desirability method is called.

6th Commit: Fixed the bug where program runs on an infinite loop
The output for the short singles list is returned correctly
The output for long singles list is not returned correctly

I didn't write up the incrementing of desirability when a zin compatible couple is passed through, because I didn't know how to do that.
I didn't write up unit tests.

List is sorted according to fussiness in ascending order.
Hobbies are put into their own array.
Aga and Zin methods working.
Aga takes the length of the intersection of the hobbies arrays of the singles, and if not 0 then they are compatible.
Match method first checks for Aga and Zin compatibility, then if one is true, continues to the average desirability method.
